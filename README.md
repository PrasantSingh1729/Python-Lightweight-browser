# Python Lightweight Browser
This browser is very light and doesn't take many system resources. <br/> 
If your PC has less than 2 GB RAM then your PC might not be able to handle the heavy browsers like chrome and Mozilla, <br/>
You can try my browser instead. <br/>

### **To use this browser**
- Step 1 : Install python3 <br/>
Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Step 2 : Install requirements.txt <br/>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Step 3 : run browser.pyw <br/>
```python browser.pyw```<br/>
you can also directly run it by double-clicking on the browser.pyw file.
